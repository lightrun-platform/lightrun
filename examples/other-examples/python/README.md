# Sample Python App

This is a sample Python application for running Lightrun, that consumes configuration from an `agent.config` file.
The app is a sleep loop, that prints a message every 5 seconds.

To run Lightrun with an app you need your configuration details. To find these, log into the [Lightrun Management Portal](https://app.lightrun.com/) and look inside the **Download the Agent** section. Fill your params for `company` and `company_key` in the `agent.config` file.

**Note:** Use `pip install lightrun` to install the Lightrun agent for Python.
